Contribution
If you want to contribute, feel free to let me know. The job_count.py script is in progress with the intention for it to be a webscraper.

WARNING: If you do webscrape LinkedIn, you may be banned from the site. Currently, the scraper (job_count.py) shouldn't do enough for that to happen.
If you use these scripts, you are aknowledging the risks and you accept responsibility for any consequences that result from using these scripts.
jobct.py is a simple program that runs on the terminal and does not connect to anything except the Jobs.txt file.
